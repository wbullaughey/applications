This message was sent to you since your email %{forward} is on the the alias list %{alias}.

UCWC has completed the move to a new alias message service (ForwardEmail). 

Please reply to this message to let me know the alias you are on is working.

Some of the aliases like chairs@ucwc.org are used to group multiple aliases together. If your alias is on one of these groups you will receive an email to both the group and the individual alias your personal email is on. Please reply to all of these messages.

Thank you
Wayne Bullaughey

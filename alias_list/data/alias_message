This message was sent to you since your email %{forward} is on the the alias list %{alias}.

We are updating the email alias list for UCWC. The alias list lets you send an email to an address like president@ucwc.org which then gets sent to Matt's personal email address. Some of the aliases get sent to just one address. Others like board@ucwc.org get sent to all members of the Board of the UCWC.

Please reply to this message with the answers to three questions:

    1) Do you know if the email list %{alias} is still in use?
    2) And if so, should your email %{forward} still be on the email list %{alias}?
    3) If you should be taken off, do you know of someone who should replace you or be added to the %{alias} alias?

Thank you
Wayne Bullaughey

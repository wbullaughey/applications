This message was sent to you since your email %{forward} is on the the alias list %{alias}.

We are updating the email alias lists for UCWC. The alias lists lets you send an email to an address like president@ucwc.org which then gets sent to Matt's personal email address. Some of the aliases get sent to just one address. Others like board@ucwc.org go to an entire committee or group.

Some of the alias lists include other aliases. For example, the alias executive-team@ucwc.org includes finance@ucwc.org. The finance@ucwc.org alias lists my personal email wayne-bu@ucwc-pa.org. In this case I would get two emails. One saying finance@ucwc.org is on the executive-team@ucwc.org alias and the second saying wayne-bu@ucwc-pa.org is on the finance@ucwc.org alias.

    1) Do you know if the email list %{alias} is still in use?
    2) Do you know of someone who should be added to the %{alias} alias?

Thank you
